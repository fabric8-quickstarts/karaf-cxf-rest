# Karaf CXF REST QuickStart

This quickstart demonstrates how to create a RESTful (JAX-RS) web service using CXF and expose it through the OSGi HTTP Service.

The REST service provides a customer service that supports the following operations

- PUT /customerservice/customers/ - to create or update a customer
- GET /customerservice/customers/{id} - to view a customer with the given id
- DELETE /customerservice/customers/{id} - to delete a customer with the given id
- GET /customerservice/orders/{orderId} - to view an order with the given id
- GET /customerservice/orders/{orderId}/products/{productId} - to view a specific product on an order with the given id

When the application is deployed, you can access the REST service using a web browser.

### Building

The example can be built with

    mvn clean install

### Running the example in fabric8

It is assumed that OpenShift platform is already running. If not you can find details how to [Install OpenShift at your site](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/install/index.html).

The example can be built and deployed using a single goal:

    mvn -Pf8-deploy

When the example runs in OpenShift, you can use the OpenShift client tool to inspect the status

To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>

You can also use the OpenShift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/getting_started/developers/developers_console.html#tutorial-video) to manage the
running pods, and view logs and much more.

### Access services using a web browser

You can use any browser to perform a HTTP GET.  This allows you to very easily test a few of the RESTful services we defined:

Notice: As it depends on your OpenShift setup, the hostname (route) might vary. Verify with `oc get routes` which hostname is valid for you.  Add the '-Dfabric8.deploy.createExternalUrls=true' option to your maven commands if you want it to deploy a Route configuration for the service.

Use this URL to display the root of the REST service, which also allows to access the WADL of the service:

    http://quickstart-cxf-rest.vagrant.f8/cxf/crm

Use this URL to display the XML representation for customer 123:

    http://quickstart-cxf-rest.vagrant.f8/cxf/crm/customerservice/customers/123

You can also access the XML representation for order 123 ...

    http://quickstart-cxf-rest.f8/cxf/crm/customerservice/customers/123

**Note:** if you use Safari, you will only see the text elements but not the XML tags - you can view the entire document with 'View Source'

### To run a command-line utility:

You can use a command-line utility, such as cURL or wget, to perform the HTTP requests.  We have provided a few files with sample XML representations in `src/test/resources`, so we will use those for testing our services.

1. Open a command prompt and change directory to `karaf-cxf-rest`.
2. Run the following curl commands (curl commands may not be available on all platforms):

    * Create a customer

            curl -X POST -T src/test/resources/add_customer.xml -H "Content-Type: application/xml" http://quickstart-cxf-rest.f8/cxf/crm/customerservice/customers

    * Retrieve the customer instance with id 123

            curl http://quickstart-cxf-rest.f8/cxf/crm/customerservice/customers/123

    * Update the customer instance with id 123

            curl -X PUT -T src/test/resources/update_customer.xml -H "Content-Type: application/xml" http://quickstart-cxf-rest.f8/cxf/crm/customerservice/customers

    * Delete the customer instance with id 123

             curl -X DELETE http://quickstart-cxf-rest.f8/cxf/crm/customerservice/customers/123

### Running the example using OpenShift S2I template

The example can also be built and run using the included S2I template quickstart-template.json.

The application can be run directly by first editing the template file and populating S2I build parameters, including the required parameter GIT_REPO and then executing the command:

    oc new-app -f quickstart-template.json

Alternatively the template file can be used to create an OpenShift application template by executing the command:

    oc create -f quickstart-template.json

#### Integration Testing

The example includes a [fabric8 arquillian](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8/tree/master/components/fabric8-arquillian) Kubernetes Integration Test. 
Once the container image has been built and deployed in Kubernetes, the integration test can be run with:

	mvn test -Dtest=*KT

The test is disabled by default and has to be enabled using `-Dtest`. [Integration Testing](https://fabric8.io/guide/testing.html) and [Fabric8 Arquillian Extension](https://fabric8.io/guide/arquillian.html) provide more information on writing full fledged black box integration tests for Kubernetes. 

### More details

You can find more details about running this [quickstart](http://fabric8.io/guide/quickstarts/running.html) on the website. This also includes instructions how to change the Docker image user and registry.
